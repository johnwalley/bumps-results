The first four lines describe the event. Then comes the starting order for each division. Finally we have the results for each day.

Results start with the bottom crew in each division (the sandwich crew for all but the lowest division).

| Entry | Explanation            |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| r     | rowed over             |
| u     | bumped up one place    |
| o3    | overbumped up 3 places |
| e-2   | moved down 2 places    |

A crew which has been (over)bumped down does not need an entry as it is implied by the entry for the crew which bumped up.

Crews are typically represented by an [abbreviation](abbreviations.txt).
